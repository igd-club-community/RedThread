KAMAKURA SHADERS v1.0.8
=======================

Updated 2018/7/12

Kamakura Shaders is a collection of shaders and components focusing on Non-Photorealistic
Rendering for Unity with a bunch of features and adjustable parameters in a user-friendly
interface.


NOTES
-----
- Target Environment: Unity 5.6.x ~ Unity 2017.4, Unity 2018.2.0b3
- Graphics API DirectX9: Screen Space Hatch feature is not functioning on this graphics API
- These shaders has not been tested yet on console platforms
  (PS4 / WiiU / Switch / Xbox One)


CHANGELOG
---------

### v1.0.8
- Now Rim can use color from GI
- A new patch tool to fix materials with invalid / obsolete parameters that can be accessed in
  "Kayac/Kamakura Shaders/Check For Patch" menu
- LocalLight and CubeColorLocalSpaceRoot component now use MaterialPropertyBlock so it does
  not make changes to Material assets. Due to this change, some materials may need to be
  updated using the new patch tool
- Improved Copy-Paste function: select all properties of a feature by pressing alt-key when
  selecting
- Fixed a problem where CubeColor outputs inaccurate color for Ambient and Rim on certain
  devices
- Fixed disappearing Outline bug in a certain case
- Removed Outline Write Depth parameter so Outline will always write depth buffer
- Added Auto Adjust Render Queue flag property to avoid confusion caused by the implicit
  auto adjustment of render queue when Blend Mode is changed

### v1.0.7
- Updated Dreamy Character model

### v1.0.6
- Reenabled point and spot light attenuation as Unity patched the bug in Unity 2018.2.0b3
- Fixes non-uniform outline width bug

### v1.0.5
- Point light and spot light attenuation is temporarily disabled due to a bug in
  Unity 2018.1.0f2

### v1.0.4
- Fixed normal seams problem
- Improved Outline: scale-independent outline. Back-face outline is now
  calculated in clip-space, so it might be necessary to adjust outline
  thickness parameter on existing materials

- Added Blend Mode (Normal, Multiply) for Hatch and Shadow
- Added Normal Intensity property

### v1.0.1

### v1.0.0
- 3 Shaders included: Kamakura, Kamakura Hair, Kamakura 2D
- Kamakura (Kamakura-Standard) for general non-photorealistic rendering
- Kamakura Hair (Kamakura-Standard-Hair) for hair specific rendering
- Kamakura 2D (Kamakura-2D) for 2D graphics object
